2020 was the year I began doing research at my university. It was this year that I was granted the [NSF S-STEM scholarship](https://www.uvu.edu/biology/s_stem_scholarship.html) that has given me the opportunity to devote so much time to something I am so passionate in studying. <br> <br>

## S-STEM Presentation - December 2020

<br> With Fall 2020 being the first semester I was involved with this program, we had an Introduction to Research class that we attended, allowing us to rotate through the labs of those professors on our campus. I was intrigued with the research of Dr. Britt Wyatt, and we decided to work together for the future. As part of this class, one assignment was to create a plan for a project that we would present to our fellow cohort and faculty. Attached is the presentation that I created for that small conference.
