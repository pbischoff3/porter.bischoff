## About Me

My name is Porter Bischoff. I am from Heber City, UT, and I am currently
a undergraduate student at Utah Valley University. I am studying
Biology, and I hope to pursue an MD/PhD degree following my time here.
<br><br> While studying at UVU, I have been blessed with so many
wonderful opportunities. As a biology student, I was granted the [NSF
S-STEM
scholarship](https://www.uvu.edu/biology/s_stem_scholarship.html),
allowing me to have a strong focus on research I am interested in as an
undergraduate. I was involved with Station1 as a [Station1 Frontiers
Fellow](https://www.station1.org/sff). This was a wonderful experience
that included "an exciting research internship in emerging areas of
science and technology with leading established and startup partner
companies, research institutes, and nonprofit organizations, a
cross-interdisciplinary shared curriculum, and personal and professional
advancement activities including inclusive leadership and collaboration,
scientific and technical communication, networking, and more." I worked
with [GC Therapeutics](https://www.gc-tx.com/) as an intern following my
time with Station1, and this provided me the unique experience of
working with a biotech startup on the cutting edge of curing incurable
diseases through stem cell implantation. Currently, I am an intern at
Utah Valley University with Provost Wayne Vaught as his [Presidential
Intern](https://www.uvu.edu/president/interns/index.html). In this
position, I have learned professionalism in a way that I couldn't have
otherwise. This position has provided me the opportunity to meet with
professionals both at the university as well as in the community, and it
has given me the chance to learn from some of the best people that the
state has to offer. <br><br> I am the oldest of 5, and I love my family
so much. They are truly my best friends. I have a dog named Bubba that
enjoys doing homework with me, and I love watching basketball. Sadly, I
am a disappointed Utah Jazz fan.
