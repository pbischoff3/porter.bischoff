    "text": "My name is Porter Bischoff. I am from Heber City, UT, and I am currently a undergraduate student at Utah Valley University. I am studying Biology, and I hope to pursue an MD/PhD degree following my time here.  While studying at UVU, I have been blessed with so many wonderful opportunities. As a biology student, I was granted the NSF S-STEM scholarship, allowing me to have a strong focus on research I am interested in as an undergraduate. I was involved with Station1 as a Station1 Frontiers Fellow. This was a wonderful experience that included “an exciting research internship in emerging areas of science and technology with leading established and startup partner companies, research institutes, and nonprofit organizations, a cross-interdisciplinary shared curriculum, and personal and professional advancement activities including inclusive leadership and collaboration, scientific and technical communication, networking, and more.” I worked with GC Therapeutics as an intern following my time with Station1, and this provided me the unique experience of working with a biotech startup on the cutting edge of curing incurable diseases through stem cell implantation. Currently, I am an intern at Utah Valley University with Provost Wayne Vaught as his Presidential Intern. In this position, I have learned professionalism in a way that I couldn’t have otherwise. This position has provided me the opportunity to meet with professionals both at the university as well as in the community, and it has given me the chance to learn from some of the best people that the state has to offer.  I am the oldest of 5, and I love my family so much. They are truly my best friends. I have a dog named Bubba that enjoys doing homework with me, and I love watching basketball. Sadly, I am a disappointed Utah Jazz fan."

I was intrigued with the research of Dr. Britt Wyatt, and we decided to work together for the future. As part of this class, one assignment was to create a plan for a project that we would present to our fellow cohort and faculty. Attached is the presentation that I created for that small conference.\n\n\n\nClick to Download"
