This trend is particularly pronounced in STEM disciplines. FGSs are more likely to be communally oriented which contrasts the typical values of universities that value individual accomplishments. This generates a disconnect between FGS’s values and the perceived values of STEM. However, limited data is available from teaching institutions that are open-enrollment. In addition, few studies have examined peer interactions as a specific source of science motivation and communal views of science. This study examined student’s cooperative experiences with peers and STEM motivation through pre/post-test survey collection within STEM classes. Students were asked questions addressing STEM motivation, the value of working with others and their community, and the community orientation of STEM disciplines. Early results show that FGS do indeed rely on cooperative experiences with peers to judge the communal orientation of science which then impacts their science motivation. We predict that similar trends will be seen for women and that these trends will be significantly weaker for CGSs. Our next steps include continuing with the data analysis. Also, this survey was taken when COVID-19 caused an emergency transition to online learning. Future data collection will provide a comparison to better understand the impacts of the emergency transition on STEM students."

Recruitment and retention in STEM can be influenced by a student’s connection to the STEM community, science identity, and engagement. Yet none of this research has investigated the impact of having either a medical experience or chronic condition on our STEM students despite other research indicating medical students with medical conditions are less likely to complete their degree. Additionally, individuals with medical conditions tend to feel disconnected from others and experience higher levels of stress during their life. Thus, it is important to study the potential impacts of medical experiences and conditions on undergraduate students. This study explores the potential impacts of having a medical experience or chronic condition on students taking science classes at an open enrollment institution. Specifically, we hypothesized acute medical experiences may include a limited number of interruptions to one’s daily lifestyle and education and thus have a smaller impact on science students in comparison to students with chronic medical conditions. We specially focused on how acute medical experiences and chronic conditions may be related to varying levels of student science career motivation, science interest, science self-determination, engagement of science outside of the classroom, communal view of science, and value of peers in their classroom. Pre-course data was collected from 1280 students across 14 biology courses (including non-majors) taught by 16 different instructors at a focused-teaching institution. Surprisingly, 55% of students surveyed reported having an experience with an acute medical condition and 20% reported having a chronic condition. This indicates that medical experiences and chronic medical conditions are indeed an important and large identity to investigate further. Interestingly, there were no significant variations for students with acute medical experiences across science career motivation, science interest, science self-determination, engagement of science outside of the classroom, communal view of science, and value of peers in their classroom. However, we did see significant differences for students with chronic medical conditions depending on the major of the student (biology major, non-biology STEM major, pre-health professional major, or non-STEM major). Specifically, non-STEM majors had more appreciation and engagement with STEM if they also had a chronic medical condition. Further investigation of the potential differences for students with chronic medical conditions will continue to be explored with a post-survey."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In conclusion, this study sheds light on the potential impact of medical experiences and chronic conditions on students taking science classes at an open enrollment institution. The findings indicate that a considerable number of students, around 57%, reported having a medical experience, while 22% reported having a chronic condition. These numbers highlight the significance of investigating the influence of medical identities on students’ experiences further. The study’s main hypotheses were supported, revealing that an increase in academic interruptions due to medical experiences led to decreased science motivation, as well as lower senses of belonging, self-efficacy, and self-determination.\n\nNegative Effects\nIt was particularly interesting to observe that students who had more medical interruptions experienced a notable decrease in their sense of belonging and self-efficacy, emphasizing the potential challenges that medical experiences can pose to academic engagement and self-confidence. This insight is crucial for educators and institutions to recognize and address, as it may have profound implications for students’ overall success and well-being in science courses.\n\n\nPositive Effects\nHowever, a noteworthy and encouraging finding was that some students who had experienced medical experiences displayed higher levels of science immersion and motivation. This suggests that medical experiences can also positively influence student engagement with science, potentially prompting students to explore these experiences further within the context of scientific understanding. These positive associations between medical experiences and science motivation are promising, as they may indicate pathways for fostering increased interest and participation in scientific disciplines among affected students.\n\n\nImportance\nIn light of these results, it becomes evident that acknowledging and accommodating medical identities and experiences in science education is paramount. By recognizing the potential challenges students face due to medical interruptions and offering support and inclusive teaching strategies, educators can help mitigate the negative effects on students’ sense of belonging and self-efficacy. Moreover, incorporating medical experiences into the curriculum could harness the positive influence they have on science motivation, thereby fostering a more engaging and supportive learning environment for all students.\n\n\nNext Steps\nMoving forward, science instructors and institutions should consider the implications of this study as they modify course content and pedagogy to be more inclusive and supportive of students with medical experiences and chronic conditions. Emphasizing a student-centered approach and providing appropriate resources can help create a conducive learning environment where all identities, including those shaped by medical experiences, are embraced and empowered. By doing so, science education can evolve to be more inclusive, enriching the educational journey of all students and ultimately contributing to a more diverse and innovative scientific community."

    "text": "In conclusion, this study sheds light on the potential impact of medical experiences and chronic conditions on students taking science classes at an open enrollment institution. The findings indicate that a considerable number of students, around 57%, reported having a medical experience, while 22% reported having a chronic condition. These numbers highlight the significance of investigating the influence of medical identities on students’ experiences further. The study’s main hypotheses were supported, revealing that an increase in academic interruptions due to medical experiences led to decreased science motivation, as well as lower senses of belonging, self-efficacy, and self-determination.\n\nNegative Effects\nIt was particularly interesting to observe that students who had more medical interruptions experienced a notable decrease in their sense of belonging and self-efficacy, emphasizing the potential challenges that medical experiences can pose to academic engagement and self-confidence. This insight is crucial for educators and institutions to recognize and address, as it may have profound implications for students’ overall success and well-being in science courses.\n\n\nPositive Effects\nHowever, a noteworthy and encouraging finding was that some students who had experienced medical experiences displayed higher levels of science immersion and motivation. This suggests that medical experiences can also positively influence student engagement with science, potentially prompting students to explore these experiences further within the context of scientific understanding. These positive associations between medical experiences and science motivation are promising, as they may indicate pathways for fostering increased interest and participation in scientific disciplines among affected students.\n\n\nImportance\nIn light of these results, it becomes evident that acknowledging and accommodating medical identities and experiences in science education is paramount. By recognizing the potential challenges students face due to medical interruptions and offering support and inclusive teaching strategies, educators can help mitigate the negative effects on students’ sense of belonging and self-efficacy. Moreover, incorporating medical experiences into the curriculum could harness the positive influence they have on science motivation, thereby fostering a more engaging and supportive learning environment for all students.\n\n\nNext Steps\nMoving forward, science instructors and institutions should consider the implications of this study as they modify course content and pedagogy to be more inclusive and supportive of students with medical experiences and chronic conditions. Emphasizing a student-centered approach and providing appropriate resources can help create a conducive learning environment where all identities, including those shaped by medical experiences, are embraced and empowered. By doing so, science education can evolve to be more inclusive, enriching the educational journey of all students and ultimately contributing to a more diverse and innovative scientific community."

Success in STEM can be influenced by a student’s connection to the STEM community, science identity, and engagement. Despite this, no research has investigated the impact of having either a medical experience or chronic condition on STEM students despite research indicating medical students with medical conditions are less likely to complete their degree. Additionally, individuals with medical conditions tend to feel disconnected from others and experience higher levels of stress during their life. Thus, it is important to study the potential impacts of medical experiences and conditions on undergraduate students’ STEM motivation.\nThis study explores the potential impact of having a medical experience or chronic condition for students taking science classes at an open enrollment institution. Specifically, we hypothesized that an increase in academic interruptions due to a medical experience would result in decreased science motivation, a lower sense of belonging, self-efficacy, and self-determination. Pre- and post-course data were collected from 390 students across 14 biology courses (including non-majors) at a teaching-focused institution. Surprisingly, 57% of students surveyed reported having a medical experience and 22% reported having a chronic condition, indicating these are indeed an important and large identity to investigate further.\nAs predicted, students who have more medical interruptions have a significantly lower sense of belonging and self-efficacy (small effect size). Interestingly, students who indicated that they have had medical experiences and as a result, more engagement with science, have significantly higher science immersion and motivation. Therefore, medical experiences could be influencing student engagement with science in both positive and negative ways. The more interruptions to a student’s academics, the more impact it can have on their sense of belonging and self-efficacy. However, if those medical experiences result in more engagement with science, students may be more motivated to understand those experiences in the context of science.

    "text": "About Introduction Methods Results Conclusion\n\n\n\nExperiences in the classrooms can lead to an increase of STEM motivation. This can come through many different aspects of the classroom experience. One study explored the positive impact that performing science practices (like hypothesizing or explaining results) can increase a students’ “felt recognition” and “classroom climate”, and these two factors increases students’ STEM motivation, STEM identity, and STEM career aspirations. Another study shares that an “intervention emphasizing communal utility value of biomedical research” can greatly increase a students’ motivation for biomedical sciences. The study also compared “self-oriented” versus “other-oriented” utility values, showing that “other-oriented” unity values shows a higher student motivation.\nPersonal experiences can also have a large influence on one’s STEM motivation. A study explored a cohort of medical students in Norway and their motivation to go into medicine. Though this is not necessarily “STEM” motivation, the comparison of medicine to STEM fields is important to note. This study went through different life experiences that the students had and compared those back to motivation for different fields in medicine. This was done through a survey, and they asked questions like “opportunity to perform research”, opportunity to care for people”, or “interest in relations between health, well-being and society”. All of these are based on experiences that students might have had on in the past in their lives, and findings show that these experiences can have a significant impact on the paths medical doctors choose. Another study explores literature regarding Black and Latinx students’ STEM motivation. In this literature review, it is clear that the life experiences that these student have can have a significant impact on their STEM motivation, compared back to experiences of the whole student population.\nPersonal experiences with medicine can influence career choice. A study explores the literature out there regarding how experiences in surgery can have an impact on their career choice. Particularly, much of the literature explores the role that rotations in medical school can influence career choice. This study makes it clear that the experiences people have with medicine can significantly impact what they choose to become. Another study explores the reasons students choose to go into medicine. Many of the common answers included “intellectual curiosity, professional autonomy, altruism, and interest in human relationships”. However, in this study, it was clear that students motivated by personal illness or family member’s illness “revealed significant[ly] greater emotional exhaustion”. This makes it clear that our experiences in life can influence our decision to go into medicine.\nChronic illnesses and medical experiences can potentially lead to more interruptions. One study explores the connection between chronic illness and suicidal ideation in adults in South Korea. What they found was that people with chronic illnesses need attention given to them in order to decrease suicidal ideation. Where suicide is tied to depression, the connection between having a chronic condition and potentially missing class becomes clear, as the students could miss more class due to the increase in depression. Another study explores how having chronic illnesses increase the incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia in older adults. In particular, it goes into what specific illnesses could cause an increase in incidence of pneumonia. Comparing this back to our study, students with chronic conditions could miss more classes due to illnesses (like pneumonia). Lastly, another study shows the influence that chronic illnesses (especially diabetes and psychiatric conditions) have on a person’s self-esteem. If a student has lower self-esteem, they may feel less likely to attend class, and therefore, these chronic conditions can lead to more medical interruptions.\n\n\n\nPorter has had a slew of medical experiences, and these experiences led him to pursue a career path in medicine. While going through his undergraduate experience, preparing for medical school, he found a real passion for science as well as medicine. Because this was relatively late in his education, he wishes that he knew this passion he had before his undergraduate studies. Therefore, this project was born, hoping to find that Porter wasn’t uncommon in his experience and assisting other students understand their passions for science sooner than later.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to Porter at portergbischoff@gmail.com !\n\n\nPrior research has investigated the recruitment and retention of certain student identities (such as gender and ethnicity) in STEM courses and careers. Success in STEM can be influenced by a student’s connection to the STEM community, science identity, and engagement. Despite this, no research has investigated the impact of having either a medical experience or chronic condition on STEM students despite research indicating medical students with medical conditions are less likely to complete their degree. Additionally, individuals with medical conditions tend to feel disconnected from others and experience higher levels of stress during their life. Thus, it is important to study the potential impacts of medical experiences and conditions on undergraduate students’ STEM motivation.\nThis study explores the potential impact of having a medical experience or chronic condition for students taking science classes at an open enrollment institution. Specifically, we hypothesized that an increase in academic interruptions due to a medical experience would result in decreased science motivation, a lower sense of belonging, self-efficacy, and self-determination. Pre- and post-course data were collected from 390 students across 14 biology courses (including non-majors) at a teaching-focused institution. Surprisingly, 57% of students surveyed reported having a medical experience and 22% reported having a chronic condition, indicating these are indeed an important and large identity to investigate further.\nAs predicted, students who have more medical interruptions have a significantly lower sense of belonging and self-efficacy (small effect size). Interestingly, students who indicated that they have had medical experiences and as a result, more engagement with science, have significantly higher science immersion and motivation. Therefore, medical experiences could be influencing student engagement with science in both positive and negative ways. The more interruptions to a student’s academics, the more impact it can have on their sense of belonging and self-efficacy. However, if those medical experiences result in more engagement with science, students may be more motivated to understand those experiences in the context of science. Information on the impact medical experiences can have on students is crucial to investigate as science instructors modify course content and pedagogy to be more inclusive of all identities present in the student population.\n\n\n\nPorter Bischoff*, Kody Garrett, Clayton Rawson, Joshua Premo, Brittney N.

    "text": "Experiences in the classrooms can lead to an increase of STEM motivation. This can come through many different aspects of the classroom experience. One study explored the positive impact that performing science practices (like hypothesizing or explaining results) can increase a students’ “felt recognition” and “classroom climate”, and these two factors increases students’ STEM motivation, STEM identity, and STEM career aspirations. Another study shares that an “intervention emphasizing communal utility value of biomedical research” can greatly increase a students’ motivation for biomedical sciences. The study also compared “self-oriented” versus “other-oriented” utility values, showing that “other-oriented” unity values shows a higher student motivation.\nPersonal experiences can also have a large influence on one’s STEM motivation. A study explored a cohort of medical students in Norway and their motivation to go into medicine. Though this is not necessarily “STEM” motivation, the comparison of medicine to STEM fields is important to note. This study went through different life experiences that the students had and compared those back to motivation for different fields in medicine. This was done through a survey, and they asked questions like “opportunity to perform research”, opportunity to care for people”, or “interest in relations between health, well-being and society”. All of these are based on experiences that students might have had on in the past in their lives, and findings show that these experiences can have a significant impact on the paths medical doctors choose. Another study explores literature regarding Black and Latinx students’ STEM motivation. In this literature review, it is clear that the life experiences that these student have can have a significant impact on their STEM motivation, compared back to experiences of the whole student population.\nPersonal experiences with medicine can influence career choice. A study explores the literature out there regarding how experiences in surgery can have an impact on their career choice. Particularly, much of the literature explores the role that rotations in medical school can influence career choice. This study makes it clear that the experiences people have with medicine can significantly impact what they choose to become. Another study explores the reasons students choose to go into medicine. Many of the common answers included “intellectual curiosity, professional autonomy, altruism, and interest in human relationships”. However, in this study, it was clear that students motivated by personal illness or family member’s illness “revealed significant[ly] greater emotional exhaustion”. This makes it clear that our experiences in life can influence our decision to go into medicine.\nChronic illnesses and medical experiences can potentially lead to more interruptions. One study explores the connection between chronic illness and suicidal ideation in adults in South Korea. What they found was that people with chronic illnesses need attention given to them in order to decrease suicidal ideation. Where suicide is tied to depression, the connection between having a chronic condition and potentially missing class becomes clear, as the students could miss more class due to the increase in depression. Another study explores how having chronic illnesses increase the incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia in older adults. In particular, it goes into what specific illnesses could cause an increase in incidence of pneumonia. Comparing this back to our study, students with chronic conditions could miss more classes due to illnesses (like pneumonia). Lastly, another study shows the influence that chronic illnesses (especially diabetes and psychiatric conditions) have on a person’s self-esteem. If a student has lower self-esteem, they may feel less likely to attend class, and therefore, these chronic conditions can lead to more medical interruptions."

While going through his undergraduate experience, preparing for medical school, he found a real passion for science as well as medicine. Because this was relatively late in his education, he wishes that he knew this passion he had before his undergraduate studies. Therefore, this project was born, hoping to find that Porter wasn’t uncommon in his experience and assisting other students understand their passions for science sooner than later.

This would be important for a tertiary level of decision making, or even as a means to help decide after being accepted to multiple schools.\n\n\n40 Highest Home Prices\n\nkeeps2 &lt;- c(\"short_name\",\"home\")\ntemp2 = my_df[keeps2]\n\ntop15 &lt;- temp2 %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(home)) %&gt;% \n  slice(1:40)\n\ntop15\n\n          short_name    home\n1           Stanford 4047000\n2      Cal San Diego 2600000\n3  Cal San Francisco 1300000\n4         Cal Irvine 1200000\n5         Washington  984000\n6                USC  965000\n7               UCLA  965000\n8          Dartmouth  912000\n9          Cal Davis  875000\n10  SUNY Stony Brook  759000\n11           Hofstra  759000\n12          New York  759000\n13   Albert Einstein  759000\n14    SUNY Downstate  759000\n15          Columbia  759000\n16               NYU  759000\n17          Mt Sinai  759000\n18           Cornell  759000\n19             Tufts  741000\n20           Harvard  740000\n21          Boston U  739000\n22            U of U  625000\n23            Nevada  624000\n24            Howard  600000\n25        Georgetown  600000\n26            Oregon  600000\n27               UNC  591000\n28        Loma Linda  591000\n29          Colorado  575000\n30             Miami  494000\n31    South Carolina  477000\n32          Michigan  471000\n33          Virginia  467000\n34           Rutgers  439000\n35           Meharry  437000\n36        Vanderbilt  437000\n37     South Florida  405000\n38         Rutgers 2  402000\n39         Morehouse  390000\n40             Emory  390000\n\ntop15 %&gt;% \n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = short_name, y = home))+\n  geom_point()+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=60, hjust=1))\n\n\n\n\n Again, not a decision maker, but something to be mindful of for the future.\n\n\n\n\n1st Analysis\n\nResearch vs. Primary Care\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            short_name school_rank\n1    Cal San Francisco    3.605551\n2           Washington    9.055385\n3              Harvard    9.055385\n4                 Pitt   17.204651\n5                 Pitt   17.204651\n6         Pennsylvania   20.880613\n7                 UCLA   23.021729\n8                  UNC   25.495098\n9             Michigan   26.248809\n10              Baylor   27.202941\n11            Colorado   27.658633\n12  Texas Southwestern   29.681644\n13            Stanford   31.048349\n14              Oregon   32.249031\n15            Maryland   32.649655\n16             Chicago   36.055513\n17    Brown University   37.696154\n18       Cal San Diego   37.735925\n19                Mayo   38.626416\n20             Alabama   41.231056\n21         U Wisconsin   42.059482\n22              U of U   43.011626\n23           Minnesota   43.104524\n24          Ohio State   43.863424\n25                Iowa   44.011362\n26          Vanderbilt   44.922155\n27           Rochester   45.221676\n28            Virginia   46.097722\n29        Northwestern   46.238512\n30             Indiana   47.010637\n31             Cornell   47.127487\n32               Emory   47.413078\n33                 NYU   48.041649\n34               UMASS   48.052055\n35            Boston U   48.166378\n36           Cal Davis   51.623638\n37       Johns Hopkins   52.086467\n38            Nebraska   53.460266\n39 Washington St Louis   57.070132\n40                 USC   59.059292\n41           Dartmouth   59.203040\n42   Texas San Antonio   59.203040\n43             Florida   60.605280\n44                  KU   64.776539\n45     Albert Einstein   67.119297\n46          Cincinnati   67.475922\n47                Yale   68.731361\n48               Tufts   71.840100\n49            Mt Sinai   71.847060\n50       South Florida   72.470684\n\n\nThis is an exploration of the data. What I did here was visualize the data in a cartesian coordinate system, with research and primary care rank being on the x and y systems. This helped me visualize how the two relate.\n\nWith this, I wanted to see which of the schools was “closest” to 0, as that would be the one that is absolute best. I took the square root of each the research rank squared and primary care rank squared. According to pygathorean theory, this will give the length of the line from “0,0”. The smaller the number, the better the combined ranks.\n\nAccording to this, Cal San Fran is the best school, according to the combination of research and primary care.\n\n\nResearch and Temple Distance\nUltimately, I love research and I love the temple. I think that these are the two biggest things I hope to consider. Let’s explore the two together, similar to the last one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot explores research rank and distance to the temple, with the closer one is to zero being the better result. I need to run a similar square root assessment as before. \n\n\n             short_name temple_research\n1                   NYU        3.773592\n2               Harvard        5.099020\n3          Pennsylvania        6.390618\n4              Columbia        7.068239\n5              Mt Sinai       11.280514\n6               Cornell       14.142136\n7            Washington       15.000000\n8   Washington St Louis       17.804494\n9                  UCLA       19.037857\n10        Cal San Diego       20.080837\n11    Cal San Francisco       20.223748\n12           Vanderbilt       23.021729\n13                 Duke       25.709920\n14                Emory       25.864261\n15   Texas Southwestern       26.405492\n16                 Pitt       28.653098\n17                 Pitt       28.653098\n18         Northwestern       29.410882\n19             Colorado       30.413813\n20           Ohio State       31.320920\n21                  USC       32.249031\n22                  UNC       32.649655\n23               Oregon       33.241540\n24             Boston U       34.539832\n25               U of U       35.216615\n26              Alabama       35.341194\n27             Stanford       35.902646\n28              Chicago       36.055513\n29        Johns Hopkins       37.121422\n30               Baylor       37.202150\n31      Albert Einstein       40.718546\n32                 Yale       45.122057\n33             Maryland       45.453273\n34            Minnesota       46.238512\n35              Indiana       46.529560\n36        South Florida       47.032329\n37             Michigan       48.104054\n38    Texas San Antonio       48.507731\n39            Rochester       50.931326\n40           Cal Irvine       51.039201\n41                Miami       51.865210\n42            Cal Davis       54.083269\n43     Thomas Jefferson       56.022852\n44                Tufts       56.222771\n45           Georgetown       56.750683\n46                UMASS       61.073726\n47             Illinois       61.326992\n48 Mcgovern Puerto Rico       61.400326\n49               U Conn       62.104428\n50                   KU       65.734314\n\n\nAwesome, another analysis down. With this, we can be assured that NYU is the best for research and temple distance.\n\n\nResearch and MCAT Score\nI am sure there is, but my next thought was what the correlation looked like between research rank and MCAT score. A simple plot should show this information to me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlright, based on that alone, the regression seems super strong. I don’t need much more statistical analysis.

What I did here was visualize the data in a cartesian coordinate system, with research and primary care rank being on the x and y systems. This helped me visualize how the two relate.\n\nWith this, I wanted to see which of the schools was “closest” to 0, as that would be the one that is absolute best. I took the square root of each the research rank squared and primary care rank squared. According to pygathorean theory, this will give the length of the line from “0,0”. The smaller the number, the better the combined ranks.\n\nAccording to this, Cal San Fran is the best school, according to the combination of research and primary care.\n\n\nResearch and Temple Distance\nUltimately, I love research and I love the temple. I think that these are the two biggest things I hope to consider. Let’s explore the two together, similar to the last one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot explores research rank and distance to the temple, with the closer one is to zero being the better result.

A simple plot should show this information to me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlright, based on that alone, the regression seems super strong. I don’t need much more statistical analysis. This just shows that if I want to go to a high level research university, I have to have a great MCAT score.\n\n\nResearch and Total Admittance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot is hard to read.

What I did here was visualize the data in a cartesian coordinate system, with research and primary care rank being on the x and y systems. This helped me visualize how the two relate.\n\nWith this, I wanted to see which of the schools was “closest” to 0, as that would be the one that is absolute best. I took the square root of each the research rank squared and primary care rank squared. According to pygathorean theory, this will give the length of the line from “0,0”. The smaller the number, the better the combined ranks.\n\nAccording to this, Cal San Fran is the best school, according to the combination of research and primary care.\n\n\nResearch and Temple Distance\nUltimately, I love research and I love the temple. I think that these are the two biggest things I hope to consider. Let’s explore the two together, similar to the last one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot explores research rank and distance to the temple, with the closer one is to zero being the better result. I need to run a similar square root assessment as before. \n\n\n             short_name temple_research\n1                   NYU        3.773592\n2               Harvard        5.099020\n3          Pennsylvania        6.390618\n4              Columbia        7.068239\n5              Mt Sinai       11.280514\n6               Cornell       14.142136\n7            Washington       15.000000\n8   Washington St Louis       17.804494\n9                  UCLA       19.037857\n10        Cal San Diego       20.080837\n11    Cal San Francisco       20.223748\n12           Vanderbilt       23.021729\n13                 Duke       25.709920\n14                Emory       25.864261\n15   Texas Southwestern       26.405492\n16                 Pitt       28.653098\n17                 Pitt       28.653098\n18         Northwestern       29.410882\n19             Colorado       30.413813\n20           Ohio State       31.320920\n21                  USC       32.249031\n22                  UNC       32.649655\n23               Oregon       33.241540\n24             Boston U       34.539832\n25               U of U       35.216615\n26              Alabama       35.341194\n27             Stanford       35.902646\n28              Chicago       36.055513\n29        Johns Hopkins       37.121422\n30               Baylor       37.202150\n31      Albert Einstein       40.718546\n32                 Yale       45.122057\n33             Maryland       45.453273\n34            Minnesota       46.238512\n35              Indiana       46.529560\n36        South Florida       47.032329\n37             Michigan       48.104054\n38    Texas San Antonio       48.507731\n39            Rochester       50.931326\n40           Cal Irvine       51.039201\n41                Miami       51.865210\n42            Cal Davis       54.083269\n43     Thomas Jefferson       56.022852\n44                Tufts       56.222771\n45           Georgetown       56.750683\n46                UMASS       61.073726\n47             Illinois       61.326992\n48 Mcgovern Puerto Rico       61.400326\n49               U Conn       62.104428\n50                   KU       65.734314\n\n\nAwesome, another analysis down. With this, we can be assured that NYU is the best for research and temple distance.\n\n\nResearch and MCAT Score\nI am sure there is, but my next thought was what the correlation looked like between research rank and MCAT score.

What I did here was visualize the data in a cartesian coordinate system, with research and primary care rank being on the x and y systems. This helped me visualize how the two relate.\n\nWith this, I wanted to see which of the schools was “closest” to 0, as that would be the one that is absolute best. I took the square root of each the research rank squared and primary care rank squared. According to pygathorean theory, this will give the length of the line from “0,0”. The smaller the number, the better the combined ranks.\n\nAccording to this, Cal San Fran is the best school, according to the combination of research and primary care.\n\n\n\nUltimately, I love research and I love the temple. I think that these are the two biggest things I hope to consider. Let’s explore the two together, similar to the last one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot explores research rank and distance to the temple, with the closer one is to zero being the better result. I need to run a similar square root assessment as before. \n\n\n             short_name temple_research\n1                   NYU        3.773592\n2               Harvard        5.099020\n3          Pennsylvania        6.390618\n4              Columbia        7.068239\n5              Mt Sinai       11.280514\n6               Cornell       14.142136\n7            Washington       15.000000\n8   Washington St Louis       17.804494\n9                  UCLA       19.037857\n10        Cal San Diego       20.080837\n11    Cal San Francisco       20.223748\n12           Vanderbilt       23.021729\n13                 Duke       25.709920\n14                Emory       25.864261\n15   Texas Southwestern       26.405492\n16                 Pitt       28.653098\n17                 Pitt       28.653098\n18         Northwestern       29.410882\n19             Colorado       30.413813\n20           Ohio State       31.320920\n21                  USC       32.249031\n22                  UNC       32.649655\n23               Oregon       33.241540\n24             Boston U       34.539832\n25               U of U       35.216615\n26              Alabama       35.341194\n27             Stanford       35.902646\n28              Chicago       36.055513\n29        Johns Hopkins       37.121422\n30               Baylor       37.202150\n31      Albert Einstein       40.718546\n32                 Yale       45.122057\n33             Maryland       45.453273\n34            Minnesota       46.238512\n35              Indiana       46.529560\n36        South Florida       47.032329\n37             Michigan       48.104054\n38    Texas San Antonio       48.507731\n39            Rochester       50.931326\n40           Cal Irvine       51.039201\n41                Miami       51.865210\n42            Cal Davis       54.083269\n43     Thomas Jefferson       56.022852\n44                Tufts       56.222771\n45           Georgetown       56.750683\n46                UMASS       61.073726\n47             Illinois       61.326992\n48 Mcgovern Puerto Rico       61.400326\n49               U Conn       62.104428\n50                   KU       65.734314\n\n\nAwesome, another analysis down. With this, we can be assured that NYU is the best for research and temple distance.\n\n\n\nI am sure there is, but my next thought was what the correlation looked like between research rank and MCAT score.

What I did here was visualize the data in a cartesian coordinate system, with research and primary care rank being on the x and y systems. This helped me visualize how the two relate.\n\nWith this, I wanted to see which of the schools was “closest” to 0, as that would be the one that is absolute best. I took the square root of each the research rank squared and primary care rank squared. According to pygathorean theory, this will give the length of the line from “0,0”. The smaller the number, the better the combined ranks.\n\nAccording to this, Cal San Fran is the best school, according to the combination of research and primary care.\n\n\n\nUltimately, I love research and I love the temple. I think that these are the two biggest things I hope to consider.

I have been involved here for 2.5 months, and I put in 12 hours a week in this service.\n\n\nLearning\nThis position came at a really tough time for me. I have been working as a Presidential Intern, going to school full time, and studying for the MCAT. Overall, I would say I have learned the most about my personal way to manage time. There is a lot on my plate, and I needed to find out quickly how to juggle it all at once. This has made me a better organized person. Also, managing the schedule for the Stake Presidency requires me to work with the members of the stake extensively. This helps me better treat people one by one, providing them the same love and care that I would hope is provided to me."

As student representatives, they act as advocates to their fellow Honors students when problems and questions arise concerning the Program itself, or from their interaction with professors, Honors Program Coordinators, and other students. The Honors Ambassadors work directly with Honors Program Director and student information is kept confidential (Source).” I put roughly 6 hours a month into this position, and I have been involved here for 3 months.\n\n\nLearning\nIn this position, I work primarily with underclassmen. This has taught me how to empathize in a more effective way. These students are awfully overwhelmed as they first come to college, and I am often one of their only student contacts they can lean on. I feel that I have learned how to better address a need in other people, whatever that need may be, and I have worked with the person to identify modes to resolve that need. Also, again, this required me to step out of my comfort zone and be more extroverted, and I feel like that is something that I always need to improve on."

I was involved with this position for 15 months, working roughly 1 hour per month on this.\n\n\nLearning\nThe most influential thing I learned from this experience was through my interactions with other students who had similar goals I had. They taught me how to be a better doctor in the future, and together we created a cohort of people to support each of us on our path. I learned how to be a better member of a team and a cohort."

Each intern will work directly with a member of UVU’s cabinet to create and implement high impact projects on behalf of UVU’s leadership and the university as a whole. Through working alongside cabinet, students will gain a greater knowledge of UVU’s mission, core values, and an inside look at higher education. Students will gain knowledge and skills that will enrich their academic, professional, and personal experiences (Source).” I had the opportunity to work with Provost Wayne Vaught in his management of Academic Affairs. I work 28 hours a week in this position, and I have worked here for roughly 4 months.\n\n\nLearning\nThis Internship has been career changing. The thing I have learned the most so far in this internship is the ability to be professional in nature. Our cohort of interns have met some very influential and “important” people both at our university as well as in the community. This was awfully intimidating at first, but I have had great growth in that area. I have had many opportunities where I am part of a cohort of 13 that represent the student body of our university, and I have learned to not take that responsibility lightly. Overall, I feel that I am more prepared to work in a professional, executive world. These influential people have taught me so much, and I am excited to continue learning from them as the internship continues."

I was involved with this for 3 months, giving roughly 33 hours a month towards leadership.\n\n\nLearning\nBeing a Fellow in this program taught me how to be a better part of a team, particularly in a virtual nature. The idea of science and technology being socially-directed taught me the importance of making and maintaining relationships. This helped me become a better leader because I put a higher value on my relationships."
